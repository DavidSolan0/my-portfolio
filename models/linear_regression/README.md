# About 

This section includes computational details of the capability and potential of classical linear models for solving real-life problems.
The programming includes codes in both Python and R, both presented in Jupyter notebooks. 

Each notebook is properly documented with how the results should be interpreted, **BoxCox transformations** and **validation of assumptions** are not presented. However, the original programming contains step-by-step details that led to the final model, its architecture, and validation (this is omitted since in practice this does not correspond to the results to be presented), if there is any interest in learning and knowing these theoretical details you can contact us and we will gladly share them. The above is mentioned in order to provide peace of mind that the procedures performed have strong theoretical support.
